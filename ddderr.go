/*
 DDD Error is a generic domain-driven exception wrapper made for Go.

 DDD Error aims to ease the lack of exception handling in The Go Programming Language by defining a wide selection of common exceptions which happen inside the domain and/or infrastructure layer(s).

 DDD Error is dependency-free, it uses built-in packages such as errors.
