/*
 DDD Error is a generic domain-driven exception wrapper made for Go.
 DDD Error aims to ease the lack of exception handling in The Go Programming Language by defining a wide selection of common exceptions which happen inside the domain and/or infrastructure layer(s).
 	DDD Error is dependency-free, it complies with Go's built-in error interface and avoids reflection to increase overall performance.
